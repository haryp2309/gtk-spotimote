# Spotimote

GTK based Spotify Connect remote.

NOTE: This application doesn't play any audio. This decision was made to keep the scope of the project small enough to maintain. Workaround is to run the official Spotify client or other clients like spotifyd alongside.

# Usage

NOTE: This is a MVP, so it is not packaged properly yet

1. Download `poetry` for package management
2. Run `poetry install`
3. Run `poetry run start`
